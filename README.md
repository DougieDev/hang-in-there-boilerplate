## Project Overview

  In this project we provided the functionality for a tool that will allow a user to create a motivational poster. The user can generate a random poster from a pre-provided list of images, titles, and quotes.

  The user can also create a custom poster by providing an image url, a title, and a quote.

  This new custom poster will be displayed on the main page.

  It is also possible to save a poster to a gallery by clicking on the 'Save Poster' button. If the poster already exists in the gallery, a duplicate poster will not be saved. Double-clicking on a poster in the gallery will delete it.

  As an added touch the user can click one of the three sections of the poster and change that part while leaving the rest of the poster the same. This means that you can click the image to select a new random image, while the title and quote remain as-is.
